              You will note that I am an aspiring IT professional, with a

              found a way provide technical support to colleagues and coworkers
              in my previous workplaces, and soon found that IT was my real
              passion. I value good customer service and believe that IT support
              should be approachable and friendly. My focus in the workplace is
              providing daily support to users to ensure a smooth workflow of
              tasks and maintaining the IT infrastructure to ensure security and
              stability. I have a systematic approach to troubleshooting and am
              not afraid to ask questions or research information when I do not
              know the answer.

              configuration, systematic troubleshooting, incident escalation and
              many other IT analyst-related tasks. My education experience has
              also given me exposure to the ITIL skills and methods required to
              excel at the job including problem management, service management
              and continual improvement. I believe that I am a strong candidate
              for the position, and that I will be able to immediately start
